## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive sales analysis for a pizza store. It combines **SQL** to cross-verify Power BI chart results against raw data metrics, ensuring all visualizations are accurate and **Power BI** for interactive visualization. The goal is to track key performance indicators (KPIs), understand customer behavior, and optimize menu offerings based on sales performance.

*   **Dataset:** [Pizza Sales Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/pizza-sales-dataset)
*   **Total Records:** Over 48,000 transaction rows.

## 🛠️ Key Workflow
1.  **SQL Integration:** Developed multiple SQL queries to extract KPIs and verify data accuracy. These results were cross-checked with Power BI measures to ensure 100% data integrity.
2.  **Data Modeling:** Processed raw data using Power Query and established relationships within Power BI.
3.  **Visualization:** Designed a 2-page interactive dashboard focusing on **Sales Trends** and **Product Performance (Best/Worst Sellers)**.

## 📊 Business Insights (Analysis)
Through this data analysis, several critical business insights were uncovered:

### 1. Temporal Sales Trends
*   **Peak Days:** Orders spike significantly on **Fridays and Saturdays**. This indicates a high weekend demand where pizza is a preferred social/family meal.
*   **Peak Hours:** The busiest hours for pizza orders occur during **Lunch (12 PM - 1 PM)** and **Dinner (6 PM - 8 PM)**. Staffing should be optimized for these time slots.
*   **Seasonal Effects:** Monthly trends show sales peaks in **January and July**, likely influenced by holidays or summer promotions.

### 2. Product Performance (Best/Worst Sellers)
*   **Revenue Leader:** **The Thai Chicken Pizza** generates the **Maximum Revenue**, suggesting it is the most valuable item for profitability.
*   **Popular Choice:** **The Classic Deluxe Pizza** is the **Most Ordered** and **Most Liked** pizza by volume, indicating high customer loyalty and mass appeal.
*   **Least Popular:** **The Brie Carre Pizza** contributes the **Minimum Revenue** and is the **Least Ordered** item. This suggests the flavor profile may not resonate with the current customer base.

### 3. Category & Size Analysis
*   **Top Category:** The **Classic** category outperforms all others in terms of total units sold (~27%).
*   **Size Preference:** Customers overwhelmingly prefer **Large (46%)** and **Medium (30%)** pizzas. Small and X-Large sizes represent a much smaller market share.

## 🚀 Recommendations
1.  **Staffing:** Increase kitchen and delivery capacity during Friday/Saturday dinner hours to maintain service speed.
2.  **Menu Engineering:** Consider replacing the **Brie Carre** with a new seasonal flavor or running a targeted promotion to clear inventory.
3.  **Upselling:** Since Large pizzas are the most popular, create "Family Meal Deals" centered around Large sizes to increase the Average Order Value (AOV).
